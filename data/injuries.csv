2021,HendDa00,Darrell Henderson,RB,LAR,0,"minor thumb injury but LAC also picked up Sony Michel from NE which will cut into reps"
2021,EtieTr00,Travis Etienne Jr.,RB,JAX,17,"mid-foot sprain during a preseason game against NO that will require surgery"
2021,DobbJK00,J.K. Dobbins,RB,BLT,17,"season-ending knee injury during a preaseason game against WSH"

2021,SwifDA00,D'Andre Swift,RB,DET,0,"coach unsure about conditioning, target Jamaal Williams not Swift"
2021,PresDa01,Dak Prescott,QB,DAL,0,"Prescott is slowly emerging from his shoulder injury, with reports saying he's now able to safely throw the ball 25 yards down field. It seems like he will be a healthy fantasy play"
2021,LambCe00,CeeDee Lamb,WR,DAL,0,"Lamb - who is fully vaccinated - was added to the NFL's COVID list. We don't know if he tested positive or what, but with the season still three weeks out it seems like he'll be fine. Still, it's worth monitoring"
2021,TannRy00,Ryan Tannehill,QB,TEN,0,"Tannehill is another fantasy target now on the COVID list. Like Lamb, with so much time left before the season starts he should be ok â€” but draft with caution"
2021,AiyuBr00,Brandon Aiyuk,WR,SO,0,"Typically, a top wide receiver dealing with a hamstring issue after the final preseason game would be cause for alarm, but with the schedule slated to have two weeks without games this season before Week 1 begins the second week of September, Aiyuk's ailment could be fully healed by the Niners' opener. Keep an eye on his status when you draft"
2021,HockTJ00,TJ Hockenson,TE,DET,0,"A leg injury has limited him throughout camp and has kept him out of the preseason but reports suggest it's just precautionary and that his injury issues are minor. Hockenson could be the No. 1 receiving target for Jared Goff and the Lions"
2021,TrauAd00,Adam Trautman,TE,NO,0,"We know that Jameis Winston is the starter at QB in New Orleans, but we don't know who his starting tight end will be, as Trautman will miss a few weeks with an ankle injury. He may be a waiver wire pick up once he's fully healthy"
2021,HenrHu00,Hunter Henry,TE,NE,0,"It was reported a few weeks ago that a shoulder injury would cost Henry some time, and it appears that time has been served as the tight end is back on the field for 7-on-7 drills"
2021,JoneMa02,Marvin Jones,WR,JAX,0,"minor injuries and expected to be full go for Week 1"
2021,CharDJ00,DJ Chark,WR,JAX,0,"minor injuries and expected to be full go for Week 1"

2021,HiltT.00,T.Y. Hilton,WR,IND,4,"Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton is expected to miss multiple weeks with an unspecified injury, according to Stephen Holder of The Athletic. The belief is that Hilton, who injured himself on Wednesday but returned to practice, will not miss the entire season. Without him, Michael Pittman Jr. is the favorite to benefit on the fantasy end"
2021,DowdRi01,Rico Dowdle,RB,DAL,17,"would've been the RB3 for the Cowboys behind Ezekiel Elliot and Tony Pollard. Instead, he will miss the season on IR with a hip injury, opening up more opportunities for undrafted rookies Brenden Knox and JaQuan Hardy"
2021,CoheTa00,Tarik Cohen,RB,CHI,6,"Transferred to the reserve/PUP list. This means Cohen will miss at least the first six weeks of the season. Damien Williams will serve as the No. 2 running back in the Bears backfield behind David Montgomery to open the season"
