## Dorey Rule

* The intial 6 games are critical to win because they set you up for the rest of the season
* Injuries start to be more of factor by the seventh week
* You also have more trade flexibility if you can build an early lead 

NOTE -- 2021 week six byes:

* Atlanta Falcons (ATL)
* New Orleans Saints (NO)
* New York Jets (NYJ)
* San Francisco 49ers (SO)

## ease of schedule

* always start your studs (duh)
* this does not necessarily apply to WRs and TEs
* it is a good tool for QBs and RBs
