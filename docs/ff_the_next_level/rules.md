# rules

1. Draft your team for this year, not from last year
2. Success is about team first, positions second, and players third
3. Statistics -- whether actual or projected -- are only useful as guidelines
4. Reception points (PPR) mean fair drafts, better teams, and more competition
5. Teams change every year, even when they don't
6. There is nothing as important as having a genuine feel for the game
