_Fantasy Football The Next Level: How to Build a Championship Team Every Season[^1]_

## Preseason

The basis for all fantasy sports is the accumulation of statistics that are used in awarding fantasy sports based on performance.

**Last year happened and will never happen again.**

### remove bias

We all want to think we are objective but fantasy players are NFL fans first which means they are predisposed to certain players and teams.

### learn the true value of players

_In many ways, the NFL is an entertainment sport. In all ways, fantasy football is a statistical pursuit._

### setup up customized rankings

Not all leagues value players the same based on individual point rules

## Rule 5 - Teams change every year, even when they don't

NFL is in a constant state of flux:

* new coaches and staff
* new offensive schemes
* turnover on the depth chart
* schedules are different every year

### projections

Projecting players is more of an art than a science. Rankings should never be strictly generated.

## Stats as a past guide

1. Review and project players the same as you should value them - team, position, individual
2. Analyze and understand the last **three** years of a players history
3. Review the per game statistics gained by a playerfor the previous season to determine trends and consistency

## team first

Everything an NFL player does is within the context of a team - scheme, role, offense, etc.
