## RB

Get a tier 1 if you can but SG is gonna roll with a weak RB group and play matchups (because he knows football good)

Bad D-lines for matchups:

* Seahawks
* Texans
* Falcons
* or Jaguars

## WR

Consider matchups (bad secondaries):

* Falcons
* Cowboys
* Lions
* Raiders

## QB

* Look for value and matchups
* If you're not comfortable figuring out matchups, get a tier 3 QB like Wilson or Herbert
* Also consider bye week and possible match ups for that week

## TE

* Get either a top 3 players OR go tier 4 and run with a weak position
* There is more value in RB/WR instead of over paying for a mediocre TE
