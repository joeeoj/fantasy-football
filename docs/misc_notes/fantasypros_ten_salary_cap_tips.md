_Top 10 Tips for Salary Cap Draft Domination | Player Price Range vs. Value (2021 Fantasy Football)[^1]_

## 1 - every draft is going to greatly vary in terms of value

* They are all unique...

## 2 - identify cheap talent with ROI upside

* Talent that will out perform ADP and price point
* Leave the draft the most value / ROI
* Wait until the end of the draft, don't nominate them early
* i.e. Laviska Shenault Jr. WR
* Quarters: 1 ($$$), 2 (deals deals deals), 3 ($ or nothing), 4 (no money)

## 3 - don't leave money on the table

* Nominate an early defense or kicker that you want and maybe someone will take them for $2 which wastes their money

## 4 - wait for bidding to level off?

* Don't inflate your own prices

## 5 - get your guys

* even if you have to pay a premium

## 6 - price enforce when applicable

* price enforce (pump up undervalued players) when you are ok having the player on your roster for that price
* do NOT do this if you are not comfortable winning the bid

## 7 - Be ready for the early lull on big name talent

* The first or second player are usually undervalued, which results in a correction as there are less players remaining (aka the post-lull)

**you need to have tiers**

## 8 - Nominating high profile players early to take money out of the pool that you don't like

* Or a player we don't necessarily want but would be ok getting at a deal
* At the beginning of the draft sometimes teams are skiddish on spending money and might give you a deal

## 9 - Build dummy rosters within the budget

* Given a $200 budget, build out a roster using estimated draft values
* This is a baseline to get an idea of what players can fit together
    * i.e. roster with big RBs, or WRs, or a specific top tier player like Kelce
* Sometimes it is good to have "the hammer" i.e. having more bench money than everyone so you win late round bids
* BUT the last thing you want in an salary cap league is to have money left over

## 10 - Suggested player prices are a guideline, not a strategy

* It's not just prices, it's approach
* some strategy ideas:
    * Stars and scrubs
    * Best ROI
* Create a cheat sheet with projections as a guide for price
* _I'm willing to move $5 up but no more_ - be careful about over paying

### understanding value

* Not beholden to the salary cap draft value
* If values are going to $10 over, there are going to be deals later but you can't just build a roster on 4th round players. You need top players to win.

## other

* You need to set your tiers by position
* always create a spending plan
    * general of how much to spend per position
    * excel spreadsheet to track spending your budget so you can adjust if you over spend
    * and to **keep track of everyone else's roster so you know how much money they have left**
