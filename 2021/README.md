### Rules

1. Draft your team for this year, not from last year
2. Success is about team first, positions second, and players third
3. Statistics -- whether actual or projected -- are only useful as guidelines

## League Analysis and Graphing (LAG)

You need to understand the effect fantasy scoring rules have on positions **for this year**.

* List the top 20 scorers in all positions used in your league from the previous season

## LAG / Scoring by Position

* The NFL produces roughly the same points per position every season
* The biggest variation is with the top three players that are much better than the rest
* There are also "natural tiers" aka (RB1, RB2, etc) visible in the data
